## Assignment 2

For Assignment 2, I have created an **E-commerce web application** called **Jersey World** using **React**, **Redux Toolkit**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

### Main Features:
- **Home Page**: Showcases featured products.
- **Shop Page**: Displays all available products.
- **Categories Page**: Displays product categories with icons.
- **Search Functionality**: Allows users to search products by name.
- **Filter Page**: Displays products based on search results.
- **Product Detail Page**: Shows detailed information (name, price, image, description) for each product.
- **Cart Functionality**: Users can add, view, and remove products from their cart.
- **About Us Page**: Details about the store and mission.
- **Contact Us Page**: Simple contact form and information.

### Technical Details:
- Built with **React** and **React Router DOM** for routing.
- **Redux Toolkit** used for global state management (products and cart).
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive and clean UI styling.
- **React Icons** for consistent and attractive icons across the site.

The project demonstrates a complete front-end shopping experience, responsive design, and basic client-side routing and state management principles.
