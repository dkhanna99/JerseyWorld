**Website Names**:

### What I Built

This assignment extends the Jersey World e-commerce site from Assignment 2 by integrating a full backend with Node.js,
Express.js, and MongoDB. I created a RESTful API that powers the frontend and an admin dashboard with full CRUD
functionality.

---

### ‚úÖ Core Features Implemented

- **Complete REST API** built with Express and MongoDB
- **Product Search** with multi-field "AND" logic (name, description, variants, categories)
- **Best Sellers Category**:
    - At least 1 product from each category
    - Shown dynamically on the homepage
- **Checkout System**:
    - Converts cart into order
    - Generates a unique order ID
- **Admin Dashboard**:
    - View all active carts
    - View all completed orders
    - Add, update, and delete products
    - Receive messages from ‚ÄúContact Us‚Äù form
- **Protected Routes** for Admin pages

---

### üåü Extra Feature

I built a fully functional **admin panel** with CRUD operations for products, real-time cart/order tracking, and secure
access through protected routes. The system also integrates a contact form that submits user messages to the admin
dashboard ‚Äî all data-driven and backed by MongoDB.
